Winter is the king of showmen,
Turning tree stumps into snow men
And house into birthday cakes 
And spreading sugar over lakes.
Smooth and clean and frosty white,
The world looks good enough to bite. 
That's the season to be young,
Catching snowflakes on your tounge! 
Snow is snowy when it's snowing.
I'm sorry it's slushy when it's going.
